      <h1 class="event-info-title">The Proposal</h1>
      <p class="story-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up, Victoria and her family cherished The Sound of Music, finding
        new meanings in it each year. It became her solace in tough times and a melody of her high school days. When she
        discovered Drew had never seen it, they decided to travel to Austria for their winter vacation, a place dear to
        Victoria due to her connection to the movie. Drew saw this as the perfect setting to propose. </p>
      <p class="story-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He meticulously planned the proposal, opting for the hotel where exterior shots of The Sound of Music were
        filmed. He secured a unique engagement ring, hired a photographer, and created a photo garland of their
        relationship. And so their fairytale vacation began, exploring new places as they‚Äôd done so many times before.
        That all changed their first morning at their hotel in Salzburg.</p>
      <p class="story-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        As they roamed the hotel's patio, Victoria discovered pictures of them throughout the years, leading to a
        heart-shaped arrangement of roses and balloons, asking, "Marry me?" Drew led her through this romantic path,
        surrounded by the Austrian Tirols, overflowing with heartfelt words. Overwhelmed, Victoria was left speechless
        until Drew asked the life-changing question: "Victoria, will you marry me?"</p>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <div class="flex-row"><h3 class="faq-emoji">üè®</h3>
        <h3> Do I need to find a hotel?</h3></div>
      <p>No need, we will have a room for everyone in our two massive lodges. </p>

      <hr/>

      <div class="flex-row"><h3 class="faq-emoji code-button" id="a-button">‚úàÔ∏è</h3>
        <h3> How should we get there?</h3></div>
      <p>Most people will fly into the Knoxville Airport (McGhee Tyson Airport) and drive or Uber/Lyft 50 minutes
        directly to the cabins.</p>
      <p>You are also more than welcome to make the 9-hour drive from Chicago.</p>
      <p>Cabin Address:</p>
      <p>4539 Misty Vw Dr, Sevierville, TN 37862</p>

      <div class="flex-row"><h3 class="faq-emoji">üïê</h3>
        <h3> When should I plan to arrive and leave for your wedding weekend?</h3></div>
      <p>While you‚Äôre welcome to come as early as you‚Äôd like and stay as late as you‚Äôd like, we rented the cabins from
        4:00 PM on Saturday, August 31st, 2024 until 10:00 AM on Tuesday, September 3rd, 2024.</p>

      <hr/>

      <div class="flex-row"><h3 class="faq-emoji code-button" id="r-button">üå¶Ô∏è</h3>
        <h3>Will the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception take place indoors or outdoors?</h3></div>
      <p>The ceremony will take place just outside the cabins on the private drive overlooking the Smoky Mountains. The
        cocktail hour will take place on the patio in the main cabin, which is partially covered but outdoors. The
        reception will take place inside the dining area in the main cabin, with the option to hang out on the
        patio. </p>

      <hr/>

      <div class="flex-row"><h3 class="faq-emoji code-button" id="b-button">üçî</h3>
        <h3> What will we be eating?</h3></div>
      <p>We will be catering food to the cabins.</p>
      <p> As people arrive on Saturday night we will have Chipotle catered so that as you arrive you may make whatever
        you wish for dinner.

        We are getting breakfast catered on Sunday morning, and on Sunday afternoon we‚Äôll have sandwich platters and
        fruit available.
        Sunday cocktail hour and dinner will be catered and buffet style, with desserts being the wedding cake, a
        chocolate fountain, and other sweet treats. The late-night meal for that night is TBD.

        Monday morning and afternoon will be leftovers. For those of you staying Monday night we will order in food of
        some sort.
      </p>
      <p>Each room will have a mini fridge for you to store extra food that you may want. The closest restaurants are 20
        minutes away in Pigeon Forge.</p>

      <hr/>

      <div class="flex-row"><h3 class="faq-emoji">üöó</h3>
        <h3> Will there be parking available at the cabins?</h3></div>
      <p>There are several parking spaces next to the cabins. For overflow parking, some of us may park about a mile
        away at the cabin rental company‚Äôs headquarters. </p>

      <hr/>

      <div class="flex-row"><h3 class="faq-emoji">üó∫Ô∏è</h3>
        <h3>I‚Äôll be visiting from out of town. What is there to do in the area?</h3></div>
      <p id="text-over-map"> First of all, thank you for making the trip out here! While the cabins are remote, there are nearby hiking
        trails and the cabins themselves will provide plenty of entertainment and things to enjoy.
        However, if you would like to get away then the nearest town is called Pigeon Forge and is super touristy.
        Closer to the wedding we‚Äôll provide a list of activities and places we recommend.

      <p>The beautiful thing about not hosting our reception at a traditional wedding venue is that the party never
        stops! While the party will keep going late into the night on Sunday night in the main cabin, the second cabin
        will be a quiet cabin. Because everything is happening in the same area, there will be no after-party, just the
        same party going on all night.</p>

        <p>Like I said during my Maid of Honor speech at Jenny‚Äôs wedding back in October of 2017, literally the ONLY
          not-perfect things about Jenny are that she doesn‚Äôt love animals and she‚Äôs not vegetarian or vegan. She‚Äôs the
          best, most supportive, patient, beautiful, and motivational sister anyone could ask for.
          I‚Äôve always joked that she‚Äôs so perfect you want to hate her, but she‚Äôs also so kind, selfless, and generous
          that you can‚Äôt hate her ü§™
          Every day she inspires me to be a better runner (I‚Äôll beat her marathon time one day‚Ä¶maybe üòú), sister, friend,
          and person. Our bond only grows stronger with every passing year and I‚Äôm so excited to have the roles reversed
          with her being my matron of honor and me being the bride this time around.

          Jenna is an incredible sister, role model, fashion expert, and Tampa guide. She has always inspired me to work
          hard and put myself out there. She had a huge role in helping me plan Victoria's proposal. Due to her
          excitement for the proposal, Jenna was the only one awake at 3 am. As a result she was the first person for us
          to call and share the great news! After landing in Chicago after our trip, Jenna put a perfect end to the
          proposal event with an airport family surprise with wine, snacks, gifts, and a private driver. Even though we
          have lived in different states for over 10 years, I am so grateful to still be so close with my sister. Jenna
          deserve to be my best man/person and a bridesmaid for Victoria.

        <p class="wedding-party-type-title">Co-Maid of Honor</p>
        <p>There‚Äôs no more fitting beginning to our friendship than just happening to watch Fifty Shades of Grey in the
          same theater at the same time with different groups of people, then running into each other afterward. Two and
          a half years later I was welcomed to spend Thanksgiving break with Alex‚Äôs family at her childhood home. It was
          there that I realized that Drew and I had been in the same photos/videos from the Chicago Marathon over a year
          prior to matching on Tinder. That week was also when Alex encouraged me to go on the mocha date with Drew when
          we got back to campus. Her and Abby were also the ones to read Drew‚Äôs response to my un-friendzoning message
          to him (after they helped me draft said message and Alex hit ‚Äúsend‚Äù for me) as I couldn‚Äôt bear the potential
          rejection üôà. Flash forward another 5 years and I‚Äôm so thankful to have Alex by my side as I say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù to the
          guy we were drunkenly messaging on Blackout Wednesday.

        <p>Never have I met a more loyal, trustworthy, supportive, and fun friend. She has shown me what true friendship

        <p class="wedding-party-type-title">Bridesmaid</p>
        <p>
          Without Abby, this wedding would NOT be happening‚Ä¶literally. She encouraged me to go out with Drew the first
          time, helped me draft the message to friend-zone Drew, then a few months later drafted ANOTHER message to
          un-friendzone Drew, and she and Alex were the ones to read Drew‚Äôs response to that message since I was too
          nervous to see his reaction to me reaching out after being üëªed. After a few weeks of messaging with neither me
          nor Drew asking the other out, Abby drunkenly took my phone on Unofficial and asked Drew out. From there Drew
          became the third wheel to Abby and me. Therefore, it‚Äôs only fitting to have Drew by my side as Abby and I read
          our vows and share our first kiss as a married couple‚Ä¶ üë©üèº‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©üèª (Did I get that right?)

I'm especially grateful to have Michael as a groomsman. His experience as a wedding party member is invaluable, and I appreciate the warm welcome he has extended to me into his family.

        <p>Scott is Victoria‚Äôs younger brother. He was the first sibling to hear about our engagement and his reaction was extremely encouraging and I am so thankful for that boost in confidence. We were lucky to be able to have an incredible trip together in Europe last summer. Because of his incredible driving skills we were able to easily visit the beautiful Dolomite mountains in Italy for the best week of hiking, food, and seeing Fez from that 70‚Äôs show.</p>
